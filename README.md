# SnakeExterminator
"The Snake Exterminator" is third person shooting game, which I developed using Excel VBA and the Game User Interface(UI) and visual elements developed using Adobe Photoshop CS6. The game is basically about shooting all the snakes that fall from the trees to the ground with an arrow that primarily saves everyone on Earth who is vulnerable to being bitten by the poisonous snake. The game reads that the snake hits when the arrow and the snake reach the same cell at the same time, creating a snake with an arrow. The layout consists of essential buttons, such as the Pause, Play, Reset, Exit and Shoot buttons, as well as counters for the number of remaining arrows and the number of snakes shot that appear in the upper-left corner of the game's home screen. Two spreadsheets are included in the Excel file, one is the "Settings" sheet where the acceleration with which the snake coincides, and the number of arrows can be changed. The "Information" worksheet is another one that allows the user to send the game data to a Microsoft Word file, which can be done by clicking on the individual buttons that appear after the "Handle Data" button is selected by the resulting word files respectively. "Data-Chart" and "Game-Data". In order to run and play the game please look into instructions detailed in the 'Game_Manual.pdf' file.
